Hello my name is Ruslan Gainutdinov. The entire application was made by me.
For those of you who are professional programmers, my code in this application may be seemed to be inconsistent.
I m perfectly aware of that ,according to the best practices, it is better to stay "consistent" during development of application. However I didn't follow this practice while developing this application,  I wanted to use different techniques and solutions to demonstrate my coding abilities intentionally. 
I am also very critical to my code and in constant chase for better coding skills. So any reviews and feedbacks are recommended.
