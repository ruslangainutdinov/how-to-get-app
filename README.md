## INFO

To use this service you must have an account in the app. If you donâ€™t just come through simple registration procedure. When you have an account just log in and start to use  it.

**NOTE! This application is pet project! All the cities and companies that are used in project are not related to real ones, even if their names are the same. Cities that have been used are real ones.**
