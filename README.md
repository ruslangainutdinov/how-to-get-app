# how-to-get-app

Hello my name is Ruslan Gainutdinov. The entire application was made by me.

For those of you who are professional programmers, my code in this application, may seemed to be inconsistent in some cases.
I m perfectly aware of that ,according to the best practices, it is better to stay "consistent" during development of application. I was using this practice and trying to stay consistent.
I am also very critical to my code and in constant chase for better coding skills. So any reviews and feedbacks are recommended.


This repository is my "how-to-get" application.
The technologies that have been used during development are:
-Spring Boot,
-Spring MVC,
-Hibernate ORM,
-Hibernate Validator,
-Thymeleaf,
-MySQL
I am also currently do not consider my front-end skills as professional, so I make use of Bootstrap components, which are easy and ready to use.
